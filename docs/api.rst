The PySOA API
=============

Services in PySOA are built around a client-server model with a simple service API. The core abstractions of this
API are Jobs and Actions. An Action is a unit of work performed by a Server, and a Job is a container of one or more
Actions. Each PySOA request and response encompasses exactly one whole Job. Note that, in PySOA, all "strings" are
Unicode strings (``str`` in Python 3 and ``unicode`` in Python 2) and all "bytes" are byte strings (``bytes`` in
Python 3 and ``str`` in Python 2). It is an error to interchange these, and will result in Job or Action errors, or
possibly even client-side exceptions.

Basic request flow
++++++++++++++++++

A Client may make a request to a Server by sending it a ``JobRequest`` (in ``dict`` form) containing one or more
``ActionRequest`` objects (also in ``dict`` form), along with some header information. The Server processes the Job by
executing each Action in the Job, in order, using the appropriate Action handler method for each Action. The results
returned or exceptions raised by each Action handler are collected into a ``JobResponse``. When the Job execution
terminates, either because all of the Actions have been processed or due to an exception, the Server returns the
``JobResponse`` (in ``dict`` form) to the Client.


Message data structures
+++++++++++++++++++++++

PySOA has several key data structures that you should understand before using it.


``JobRequest``
**************

The ``JobRequest`` object contains a list ``actions`` of ``ActionRequest`` objects along with two headers: ``control``
and ``context``. Both of these headers are provided to the action handler when processing each ``ActionRequest``. In
general, the ``control`` header is used for flags that affect the execution of the Job itself, such as how to handle
Action errors. The ``context`` header is for everything else, including switches (see `Versioning using switches`_),
locale, and metadata. All fields in the ``JobRequest`` are required.

- ``control`` stores values that affects the execution of the job itself. It's free-form, so technically any key is
  permitted (your middleware could take advantage of additional keys), but these are the keys currently supported
  natively in PySOA:

  + ``continue_on_error``: Tells the Server to continue processing the Job if any Action results in an error (``bool``)

- ``context`` stores other information about the request useful to the Job or Action code or middleware. Like
  ``control``, it is free-form, but these are the keys currently supported natively in PySOA:

  + ``switches``: A list of switch values (see `Versioning using switches`_)
  + ``correlation_id``: A unique ID that is generated by the Client and follows the Job and must be passed to any other
    service calls made while processing the Job and its Actions, it is used to facilitate logging, metrics, and more

- ``actions`` is a list containing ``ActionRequests``.


``ActionRequest``
*****************

- ``action`` is the required name of the Action to invoke and must be a string.
- ``body`` is a dict containing arguments for the Action and must match the request schema (if any) the request has
  defined. It is required if and only if the Action code has a required request schema. It must be ``None`` or an
  empty ``dict`` if and only if the Action code has an empty request schema.


``JobResponse``
***************

- ``actions`` is a required list of ``ActionResponses``.
- ``errors`` is a list of ``Errors``, which will be an empty list (not ``None``) if no Job errors occurred (even if
  some Action errors occurred).


ActionResponse
**************

- ``action`` is the required name of the action that was invoked and will be a string.
- ``body`` is a dict containing the response from the Action. It will always be present, but perhaps as merely an
  empty ``dict`` if the Action has no response.
- ``errors`` is a list of ``Errors``, which will be an empty list if no errors occurred for this ``ActionRequest``.


``Error``
*********

- ``code`` is a required, machine-readable string error code.
- ``message`` is a required, human-readable string error message, which your services may (optionally) localize using
  a locale field included in the ``JobRequest``'s ``context`` header.
- ``field`` is an optional identifier of the form ``'field[.subfield[.sub_subfield[....]]]'`` providing the full path
  of the field in the ``ActionRequest`` that caused the error, if applicable.
- ``traceback`` is an optional string containing the formatted exception stacktrace, if any, that applies to the error.
- ``variables`` is an optional ``dict`` of variable names and their values, if any, that apply to the error.
- ``denied_permissions`` is an optional ``list`` of unicode string permission codes, names, or other symbols. If a lack
  of permissions is the proximal cause of the error, you might find it useful to return with the error a list of the
  missing permissions so that the client can adjust, if possible, or inform the user of more useful information. This
  is fully optional and organization-specific. PySOA itself has no permissions features in it.


Servers
+++++++


The ``pysoa.server`` module contains everything necessary to write a PySOA service. The ``Action`` class provides the
parent class for your service's Actions, which are the main units of business logic, while ``Server`` class provides
the framework for running a request-response loop.

The ``Server`` is the heart of any PySOA service. It provides a standard Job processing workflow and an interface for
subclasses to implement Action handlers. It also provides a simple command line interface.

In general, ``Server`` subclasses will need to define two things: the service name and a mapping of Action names to
Action handlers. Subclasses may also perform additional setup by overriding the ``setup`` method of the base class.
Other override possibilities are ``perform_pre_request_actions``, ``perform_post_request_actions``, and
``perform_idle_actions``, though, in most cases, you should simply use middleware for such special needs. Subclasses
should not need to override any other methods on the base class.

The ``Action`` class provides an interface allowing subclasses to easily validate input, execute business logic, and
validate output. Validation is performed by `Conformity <https://github.com/eventbrite/conformity>`_ schemas, allowing
for simple, declarative input and output checking. It automatically handles validating the ``dict`` returned by the
``run`` method and placing it into an ``ActionResponse`` object.


``Server``
**********

All services provide a class that extends ``Server``. For full documentation of all of its properties and methods,
see the `Server reference documentation <reference.rst#class-server>`_.

Class Attributes
  - ``service_name``: The string name that the service will use to identify itself, and that Clients will use to call it
  - ``action_class_map``: A mapping of Action names to handlers, which are ``Action`` subclasses (in most cases it will
    be a ``dict``, but it may be any object that implements ``__getitem__`` and ``__contains__``)
  - ``use_django``: If this is ``True``, ``Server.main`` will import settings from Django. If it is ``False`` (the
    default), it will not import or use Django in any way
  - ``settings_class``: In many cases, you can simply rely on the default settings class
    (``ServerSettings``), but you may provide some other class that extends ``ServerSettings`` if you want to use the
    settings framework to bootstrap special settings for your service instead of using some other settings framework
    (such as Django)

Methods
  - ``setup``: Performs service-specific setup and takes no arguments
  - ``main``: Class method that allows the ``Server`` to be run from the command line


``Action``
**********

Your Actions do not have to extend ``Action``. An Action may be any callable object that, when invoked with a single
argument (the Server settings), returns a new callable object that accepts a single ``ActionRequest`` argument and
returns an ``ActionResponse`` object. In practical terms, ``Action`` takes care of much of this heavy lifting for you,
so it is advisable that your Actions extend ``Action``. For full documentation of all of its properties and methods,
see the `Action reference documentation <reference.rst#abstract-class-action>`_.

Class Attributes
  - ``request_schema``: A Conformity schema defining the structure of the request body.
  - ``response_schema``: A Conformity schema defining the structure of the response body.

Instance Attributes
  - ``self.settings``: The Server's full settings object (which can be accessed like a ``dict``)

Methods
  - ``validate``: An optionally-overridden method that performs custom validation, takes an ``ActionRequest`` object
    as input, and raises an ``ActionError`` to signal validation failure (in which case ``run`` will not be invoked)
  - ``run``: The main business logic method that must be implemented, takes an ``ActionRequest`` as input, and
    returns a ``dict`` matching the schema defined in ``response_schema`` or raises an ``ActionError``, and will only
    be invoked if ``validate`` is not overridden or completes without raising any exceptions


Server configuration
********************

The ``Server`` base class takes configuration in the form of a dict with the following basic structure, plus any
additional settings that you may have defined if you overrode the ``server_settings`` class property:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "transport": <transport config>,
        "middleware": [<middleware config>, ...],
        "client_routing": <client settings>,
        "logging": <logging config>,
        "harakiri": {
            "timeout": <harakiri timeout>,
            "shutdown_grace": <harakiri shutdown grace>,
        }
    }

Key
  - ``<transport config>``: See `Transport configuration`_ for more details; the base ``Server`` defaults to using the
    `Redis Gateway Transport`_
  - ``<middleware config>``: See `Middleware configuration`_ for more details
  - ``<client settings>``: Configuration for a ``Client`` that can be used to make further service calls during Action
    processing. See `Client configuration`_.
  - ``<logging config>``: A dictionary that will be used to configure the Python ``logging`` module at Server startup
    (`logging config schema <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema>`_).
  - ``<harakiri timeout>``: The server will shut down if it is inactive for this many seconds, which may be because
    the transport receive malfunctioned, or because a Job or Action is taking too long to process
  - ``<harakiri shutdown grace>``: When shutting down after ``<harakiri timeout>``, the server will wait this many
    seconds for any existing Job to finish before aborting the Job and forcing shutdown

For full details, view the sections linked above and the `ServerSettings reference documentation
<reference.rst#settings-schema-class-serversettings>`_.


Django integration
******************

The ``Server`` class is able to get configuration from Django settings automatically. If the ``use_django`` property on
the ``Server`` subclass is ``True``, the ``main`` method will automatically import the Django settings module and look
for configuration under the name ``SOA_SERVER_SETTINGS``.

The ``Server`` will also perform strategic resource cleanup before and after each request when Django integration is
enabled, mimicking the behavior of the following Django features:

* The database query log will be reset before each received request is handled.
* Old database connections will be closed after each response is sent and also when the server has been idle for some
  time without handling any requests.
* The ``close`` method will be called on all configured Django cache engines. To make your caches work ideally in a
  PySOA server environment, we recommend you use one or more of the following cache engines in your services, or
  similarly override the ``close`` method in your own cache engines:

  * ``pysoa.server.django.cache.PySOARequestScopedMemoryCache`` - The ``close`` method clears the request completely,
    so that the cache gets cleared at the end of every job request.
  * ``pysoa.server.django.cache.PySOAProcessScopedMemoryCache`` - The ``close`` method does nothing, so that the cache
    lasts for the entire server process.
  * ``pysoa.server.django.cache.PySOAMemcachedCache`` - The ``close`` method closes connections to Memcached only when
    the server is shutting down (not at the end of every request).
  * ``pysoa.server.django.cache.PySOAPyLibMCCache`` - The ``close`` method closes connections to Memcached only when
    the server is shutting down (not at the end of every request), and only on Django versions older than 1.11.0.
    (`As of Django 1.11.0 <https://github.com/django/django/commit/f02dbbe1ae02c3258fced7b7a75d35d7745cc02a>`_, the
    ``PyLibMCCache`` implementation does not close connections. Instead, it lets the library connection management take
    care of this.)


Settings without Django
***********************

If ``user_django`` is ``False`` (the default), the ``main`` method will require a command line ``-s`` or ``--settings``
argument. This must be the absolute name of a module, which PySOA will import. PySOA will then look for an attribute
on that module named ``SOA_SERVER_SETTINGS`` or ``settings``, in that order of preference.


Versioning using switches
*************************

Switches are like a special argument that every Action in a job gets. In terms of code, switches are simply integers
passed by the Client in the ``control`` header of every ``JobRequest``, and then by the Server into every Action in
that Job. To provide more flexibility for your switch definitions, switch objects and constants used in PySOA can be
*any* object that provides the method ``__int__``, or *any* object that provides the attribute ``value`` whose value
provides the method ``__int__``. (Switches must, however, be sent over the wire as simple integers within the PySOA
protocol.)

Switches are a type of feature flag and came from a need to version individual service Actions, rather than versioning
the whole service at once. There are several ways to use switches. Here are just two examples:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    from pysoa.server.action.switched import SwitchedAction

    from my_user_service.switches import USER_VERSION_2_ENABLED
    ...

    class UserActionV1(Action):
        ...  # version 1 schema and business logic

    class UserActionV2(Action):
        ...  # version 2 schema and business logic

    class UserTransitionAction(SwitchedAction):
        switch_to_action_map = (
            (USER_VERSION_2_ENABLED, UserActionV2),
            (SwitchedAction.DEFAULT_ACTION, UserActionV1),
        )

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    from my_user_service.constants import USER_VERSION_2_ENABLED
    ...

    class UserAction(Action):
        ...  # schema that applies to all versions

        def run(self, request):
            if request.switches.is_active(USER_VERSION_2_ENABLED)
                ...  # version 2 business logic
            else:
                ...  # version 1 business logic

In the first example, the helpful ``SwitchedAction`` is utilized. This is a specialized wrapper Action that defers
to other Actions based on enabled switches (or to the last or default Action if no matches are found). Using this
technique, you can have different request and/or response schemas depending on a switch, effectively applying
transitional versioning to the entire service Action. In your ``Server`` class, you just need to map a single action
name to your ``UserTransitionAction`` (instead of mapping anything directly to ``UserActionV1`` or ``UserActionV2``),
and the code in ``SwitchedAction`` takes care of the rest. For more detailed information about this approach, see the
`SwitchedAction reference documentation <reference.rst#abstract-class-switchedaction>`_.

In the second, simpler example, you only have one Action class (so your request schema and response schema remain
unchanged regardless of the switch supplied), but you can still alter the behavior (perhaps with different permissions,
validation rules, or storage logic, etc.) by checking whether a switch is active directly within your Action's ``run``
code.


Clients
+++++++

Code that needs to call one or more services will do so using a ``Client``. A single ``Client`` instance can be
configured to call one or more services—you do not need to create a different client for each service.

The ``client`` submodule provides the ``Client`` class as well as base classes for settings and middleware. Unlike the
``Server``, ``Client`` will generally not be subclassed unless there is a need to add nonstandard behavior on top of
the base ``Client``. The ``Client`` provides both blocking and non-blocking methods, and you should exercise caution
when using them together. If you call the non-blocking method to send a request, followed by a blocking method to
send-and-receive, you could encounter errors. Be sure you have completed all non-blocking operations before switching
to blocking operations.


``Client``
**********

For full documentation of all of these methods, see the `Client reference documentation <reference.rst#class-client>`_.

Methods
  - ``send_request``: Build and send a Job request and return an integer request ID, which you can then use later
    to retrieve the request response (this method does not block waiting on a response)
  - ``get_all_responses``: Return a generator with all outstanding ``JobResponse`` objects for the given service (this
    method will block or timeout until all requests sent to this service with ``send_request`` have received responses)
  - ``call_action``: Build and send a Job request with a single Action and return an ``ActionResponse``, blocking
    until the response is received
  - ``call_actions``: Build and send a Job request with one or more Actions and return a ``JobResponse``, blocking
    until the response is received
  - ``call_actions_parallel``: Build and send multiple Job requests (to a single service), each with exactly one Action,
    to be handled in any order by multiple service processes, and return the corresponding ``ActionResponse`` objects
    in the same order the Action requests were submitted, blocking until all responses are received
  - ``call_jobs_parallel``: Build and send multiple Job requests (to one or more services), each with one or more
    Actions, to be handled in any order by multiple service processes, and return the corresponding ``JobResponse``
    objects in the same order the Job requests were submitted, blocking until all responses are received
  - ``call_action_future``, ``call_actions_future``, ``call_actions_parallel_future``, ``call_jobs_parallel_future``:
    Variants of the above methods that return a ``Client.FutureResponse`` object instead of a completed response or
    responses, allowing you to send requests asynchronously, perform other work, and then use the future object to
    retrieve the expected responses.


Client configuration
********************

The ``Client`` class takes configuration in the form of a dict with the following format:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        <service name>: {
            "transport": <transport config>,
            "transport_cache_time_in_seconds": <transport cache time>,
            "middleware": [<middleware config>, ...],
        },
        ...
    }

Key
  - ``<service name>``: The ``Client`` needs settings for each service that it will call, keyed by service name
  - ``<transport config>``: See `Transport configuration`_ for more details; the base ``Client`` defaults to using the
    `Redis Gateway Transport`_.
  - ``<transport cache time>``: How long the transport objects should be cached in seconds, defaults to 0 (no cache,
    slightly lower performance, but required to be 0 in a multi-threaded application)
  - ``<middleware config>``: See `Middleware configuration`_ for more details

For full details, view the sections linked above and the `ClientSettings reference documentation
<reference.rst#settings-schema-class-clientsettings>`_.


Expansions
**********

Expansions allow the ``Client.call_***`` methods to automatically "expand" fields in a service response by making
further service calls and adding those responses to the original response. (Note: ``send_request`` and
``get_all_responses`` do not perform any expansions; only the blocking methods perform expansions.)

Expansions are based on a type system, which is optional and requires extra effort on the part of services. To support
expansions, services must include a ``_type`` field in each object in each Action response body. The indicated type
must map to an expansion type in the ``Client`` expansion configuration in order to be considered for expansions.

The ``Client.call_***`` methods take a keyword argument ``expansions``, which is a dictionary mapping types to
expansions. For each ``<type>: <expansions>`` pair in the argument, the ``Client`` will automatically perform each
expansion in the ``<expansions>`` ``list`` for each object of ``<type>`` (a string) in the response. Expanded objects
can, themselves, be further expanded recursively with the correct arguments, though you should always consider the
performance implications of this behavior before using it.


Configuring expansions
----------------------

Expansions are configured on the ``Client`` instance by using the ``expansions`` argument on initialization. This
argument accepts a dict with the following format:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "type_routes": {
            <name>: {
                "service": <service name>,
                "action": <action name>,
                "request_field": <request field name>,
                "response_field": <response field name>,
            },
            ...
        },
        "type_expansions": {
            <type>: {
                <expansion name>: {
                    "type": <expansion type>,
                    "route": <expansion route>,
                    "source_field": <source field name>,
                    "destination_field": <destination field name>,
                    "raise_action_errors": <bool>,
                },
                ...
            },
            ...
        },
    }

Key
  - ``type_routes``

    - ``<name>``: The name/key for the expansion route
    - ``<service name>``: The name of the service to call in order to expand using this route
    - ``<action name>``: The name of the action to call in order to expand using this route
    - ``<request field>``: The name of the field to place in the Action request body when making an expansion request
      through this route (the field value will be a bulk list of expansion identifiers extracted from the objects being
      expanded)
    - ``<response field>``: The name of the field returned in the Action response body that contains the expansion
      objects (the field value should be a dictionary whose keys are the identifiers from the request field and whose
      values are the individual objects corresponding to those identifiers)

  - ``type_expansions``

    - ``<type>``: A type for which you are defining expansions
    - ``<expansion type>``: The expected type of the objects returned by this expansion, which is used to look up the
      type in this same ``type_expansions`` dictionary to support nested/recursive expansions
    - ``<expansion route>``: The route to the expansion, which must match a key found in ``type_routes``
    - ``<source field name>``: The name of the field on an object of type ``<type>`` that contains the identifier that
      should be passed to the expansion route to perform the expansion
    - ``<destination field name>``: The name of the field (which should not yet exist) on an object of type ``<type>``
      that will be filled with the expanded value retrieved from the expansion route

To satisfy an expansion, the expansion processing code needs to know which service action to call and how to call it.
Type routes solve this problem by by giving the expansion processing code all the information it needs to properly call
a service action to satisfy an expansion. Type expansions detail the expansions that are supported for each type. If a
``Client`` needs to support expansions for a type, that type must have a corresponding entry in the ``type_expansions``
dictionary, and that expansion's route must have a corresponding entry in the ``type_routes`` dictionary.

For full details, view the `ExpansionSettings reference documentation
<reference.rst#settings-schema-class-expansionsettings>`_.


Expansions example
------------------

Consider a ``Client`` with the following expansions config:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "type_routes": {
            "bar_route": {
                "service": "bar_example",
                "action": "get_bars",
                "request_field": "ids",
                "response_field": "bars",
            },
        },
        "type_expansions": {
            "foo": {
                "bar": {
                    "type": "bar",
                    "route": "bar_route",
                    "source_field": "bar_id",
                    "destination_field": "bar",
                },
            },
        },
    }

You could then make a call to the ``foo_example`` service using the ``expansions`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

    result = client.call_actions(
        service_name="foo_example",
        actions=[
            {
                "action": "get_foos",
            },
        ],
        expansions={"foo": ["bar"]},
    )

The argument ``expansions={"foo": ["bar"]}`` tells the ``Client`` "for each object of type ``foo`` in the response,
perform an expansion of type ``bar``".

The ``foo_example`` service returns the following response to our ``get_foo`` request:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "action": "get_foos",
        "errors": [],
        "body": {
            "foos": [
                {
                    "_type": "foo",
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "One Foo",
                    "bar_id": 2,
                },
                {
                    "_type": "foo",
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Two Foo",
                    "bar_id": 6,
                },
                {
                    "_type": "foo",
                    "id": 3,
                    "name": "Red Foo",
                    "bar_id": 6,
                },
            ],
        },
    }

Note that the ``foo`` objects contain the field ``bar_id``, which corresponds to the ``source_field`` in the ``bar``
expansion.

Using this response, the ``Client`` automatically makes a call to the ``bar_example`` service using the ``bar_id``
values from the ``foo`` response. The call is equivalent to the following (but this is not code you would have to
write):

.. code-block:: python

    client.call_action(
        service_name="bar_example",
        body={
            "action": "get_bars",
            "body": {"ids": [2, 6]},
        },
    )

Notice that the ``bar`` IDs have been de-duplicated, so as to avoid unnecessary work done by the route target service
(``bar_example``). The ``bar_example`` service returns the following response:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "action": "get_bars",
        "errors": [],
        "body": {
            "bars": {
                2: {
                    "_type": "bar",
                    "id": 2,
                    "stuff": "baz",
                },
                6: {
                    "_type": "bar",
                    "id": 6,
                    "stuff": "qux",
                },
            },
        },
    }

The ``bar_example`` response is added to the original response from the ``foo_example`` service, adding the ``bar``
field  (``destination_field``) to each object that has a source field (``bar_id``). The final response body looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "action": "get_foos",
        "errors": [],
        "body": {
            "foos": [
                {
                    "_type": "foo",
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "One Foo",
                    "bar_id": 2,
                    "bar": {
                        "_type": "bar",
                        "id": 2,
                        "stuff": "baz",
                    },
                },
                {
                    "_type": "foo",
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Two Foo",
                    "bar_id": 6,
                    "bar": {
                        "_type": "bar",
                        "id": 6,
                        "stuff": "qux",
                    },
                },
                {
                    "_type": "foo",
                    "id": 3,
                    "name": "Red Foo",
                    "bar_id": 6,
                    "bar": {
                        "_type": "bar",
                        "id": 6,
                        "stuff": "qux",
                    },
                },
            ],
        },
    }
    

Client exceptions
*****************

- ``ImproperlyConfigured``: The ``Client`` tried to call a service for which it did not have configuration
- ``Client.JobError``: Raised by ``Client.call_***`` methods when the Job response contains job-level errors
- ``Client.CallActionError``: Raised by ``Client.call_***`` methods when one or more Actions in the response(s) contain
  action-level errors


Serialization
+++++++++++++

The ``Serializer`` class allows Clients and Servers to communicate using a common format. This library provides
serializer classes for `MessagePack <https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack>`_ (the default and recommended) and JSON
formats, and the base ``Serializer`` class can be extended to use any format that a developer may wish to use. The
``Serializer`` interface is simple:


``Serializer``
**************

Class Attributes
  - ``mime_type``: A unique string that identifies the type of serializer used to encode a message, generally of the
    form ``application/format``, where ``format`` is the lower-case alphanumeric name of the message format (currently,
    this is unused, but it may be used in the future to allow a server to support multiple serializers simultaneously
    and use the one matching a MIME type passed from the client)

Methods
  - ``dict_to_blob``: Takes a Python dictionary and serializes it to a binary string
  - ``blob_to_dict``: Takes a binary string and deserializes it to a Python dictionary


Provided serializers
********************


MessagePack Serializer
----------------------

- Backend: `msgpack-python <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msgpack-python>`_
- Types supported: ``bool``, ``int``, ``str`` (``unicode``/2 or ``str``/3), ``dict``, ``list``, ``tuple``, ``bytes``
  (``str``/2 or ``bytes``/3), ``date``, ``time``, ``datetime``, ``decimal.Decimal``, and ``currint.Amount``
- Other notes:
  - Makes no distinction between ``list`` and ``tuple`` types—both types will be deserialized as lists


JSON Serializer
---------------

- Backend: `json <https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html>`_
- Types supported: ``bool``, ``int``, ``str`` (``unicode``/2 or ``str``/3), ``dict``, ``list``, ``tuple``
- Other notes:
  - Makes no distinction between ``list`` and ``tuple`` types—both types will be deserialized as lists
  - Fairly incomplete at the moment, relative to the MessagePack serializer, and may or may not be improved to support
    additional types in the future (would require departing from the JSON specification)


Serializer configuration
************************

The config schema for ``Serializer`` objects is just the basic PySOA plugin schema:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "path": <path to serializer class>,
        "kwargs": <optional dict of keyword args>,
    }


Serializer exceptions
*********************

- ``InvalidField``: Raised when the serializer fails to serialize a message and contains the arguments from the
  original exception raised by the serialization backend's encoding function
- ``InvalidMessage``: Raised when the serializer fails to deserialize a message and contains the arguments from the
  original exception raised by the serialization backend's decoding function.


Transport
+++++++++

The ``transport`` module provides an interface for sending messages between clients and servers. While the Client and
Server concepts deal with the high-level functionality of sending, receiving, and handling requests and responses
without any concern about their method of transmission, Transports are responsible for the low-level details of
actually transmitting PySOA protocol messages via specific backends. There are two base classes, from which all
concrete Transports must inherit:


``ClientTransport``
*******************

Methods
  - ``send_request_message``: Serialize and send a request message to a service server
  - ``receive_response_message``: Receive the first available response that a service server has sent back to this
    client and return a tuple of the request ID and deserialized response message

For full details of these methods and their usage, view the `ClientTransport reference documentation
<reference.rst#abstract-class-clienttransport>`_.


``ServerTransport``
*******************

Methods
  - ``receive_request_message``: Receive the first available request message that any client has sent to this service
    and return a tuple of the request ID, the request metadata, and the deserialized request message
  - ``send_response_message``: Serialize and send a response to the client that sent the corresponding request

For full details of these methods and their usage, view the `ServerTransport reference documentation
<reference.rst#abstract-class-servertransport>`_.


Transport configuration
***********************

The configuration schema for ``Transport`` classes is the same as for other PySOA plugins, though transports will
generally provide an extended schema with more strict ``kwargs`` values.

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "path": <path to transport class>,
        "kwargs": <optional dict of keyword args>,
    }


Transport exceptions
********************

- ``ConnectionError``: The transport failed to connect to its message backend
- ``InvalidMessageError``: The transport tried to send or receive a message that was malformed
- ``MessageReceiveError``: The transport encountered any non-timeout error while trying to receive a message
- ``MessageReceiveTimeout``: The transport timed out while waiting to receive a message
- ``MessageSendError``: The transport encountered any non-timeout error while trying to send a message
- ``MessageSendTimeout``: The transport timed out while trying to send a message
- ``MessageTooLarge``: The message passed to the transport exceeded the maximum size allowed by that transport


Redis Gateway Transport
***********************

The ``transport.redis_gateway`` module provides a transport implementation that uses Redis (in standard or Sentinel
mode) for sending and receiving messages. This is the recommended transport for use with PySOA, as it provides a
convenient and performant backend for asynchronous service requests.


Standard and Sentinel modes
---------------------------

The Redis Gateway transport has two primary modes of operation: in "standard" mode, the channel layer will connect to a
specified list of Redis hosts (which must all be master servers that support both read and write operations), while in
"Sentinel" mode, the channel layer will connect to a list of Sentinel hosts and use Sentinel to find one or more Redis
masters. In either mode, if there is just one master, all operations will happen against that one master. If there are
multiple masters, operations will proceed as follow:

1. The client uses round-robin to pick a master to which to send a request.
2. The client uses a predictable hashing algorithm to pick a master from which to receive a response, based on the
   response-receiving queue name.
3. The server uses round-robin to pick a master from which to receive requests.
4. Once the server has processed a request and is ready to receive a response, it uses the same hashing algorithm to
   pick a master to which to send the response, based on the queue name to which it is supposed to send that response,
   such that it will always send to the same master on which the client is "listening."

Configuration
-------------

The Redis Gateway transport takes the following extra keyword arguments for configuration:

- ``backend_type``: Either "redis.standard" or "redis.sentinel" to specify which Redis backend to use (required)
- ``backend_layer_kwargs``: A dictionary of arguments to pass to the backend layer

  + ``connection_kwargs``: A dictionary of arguments to pass to the underlying Redis client (see the documentation for
    the `Redis-Py library <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_)
  + ``hosts``: A list of strings (host names / IP addresses) or tuples (host names / IP addresses and ports) for Redis
    hosts or Sentinels to which to connect (will use "localhost" by default)
  + ``redis_db``: The Redis database number to use (a shortcut for specifying ``connection_kwargs['db']``)
  + ``redis_port``: The connection port to use (a shortcut for providing this for every entry in ``hosts``
  + ``sentinel_failover_retries``: How many times to retry (with an exponential-backoff delay) getting a connection
    from the Sentinel when a master cannot be found (cluster is in the middle of a failover) (only for type
    "redis.sentinel") (fails on the first error by default)
  + ``sentinel_services``: Which Sentinel services to use (only for type "redis.sentinel") (will be auto-discovered
    from the Sentinel by default, but that can slow down connection startup)

- ``message_expiry_in_seconds``: How long a message may remain in the queue before it is considered expired and
  discarded (defaults to 60 seconds, and Client code can pass a custom timeout to ``Client`` methods)
- ``queue_capacity``: The maximum number of messages a given Redis queue may hold before the transport should stop
  pushing messages to it (defaults to 10,000)
- ``queue_full_retries``: The number of times the transport should retry (with an exponential-backoff delay) sending to
  a Redis queue that is at capacity before it raises an error and stops trying (defaults to 10)
- ``receive_timeout_in_seconds``: How long the transport should block waiting to receive a message before giving up
  (on the Server, this controls how often the server request-process loops; on the Client, this controls how long
  before it raises an error for waiting too long for a response, and Client code can pass a custom timeout to
  ``Client`` methods) (defaults to 5 seconds)
- ``default_serializer_config``: A standard serializer configuration as described in `Serializer configuration`_
  (defaults to MessagePack), used to determine how requests are serialized (responses are always serialized according
  to the MIME content type of the request)
- ``log_messages_larger_than_bytes``: Defaults to 102,400 bytes, a warning will be logged whenever the transport sends
  messages larger than this (set this to 0 to disable the warning)
- ``maximum_message_size_in_bytes``: Defaults to 102,400 bytes on the client and 256,000 bytes on the server, defines
  the threshold at which ``MessageTooLarge`` will be raised.


Middleware
++++++++++

Middleware for both Server and Client uses an onion calling pattern, where each middleware accepts a callable and
returns a callable. Each middleware in the stack is called with the middleware below it, and the base level middleware
is called with a base processing method from the ``Server`` or ``Client`` classes.


``ServerMiddleware``
********************

The ``ServerMiddleware`` class has an interface that allows it to act at a Job level or at an Action level, or both,
depending on which part(s) of the interface it implements. It has two methods, ``job`` and ``action``, each of which
wraps a callable that does the work of processing a Job or Action. See the `<ServerMiddleware reference documentation
<reference.rst#class-servermiddleware>`_ for more information about how to implement Server middleware.


``ClientMiddleware``
********************

Client middleware works similarly to Server middleware, using an onion calling pattern. Client middleware is built
around the client request/response workflow. The ``ClientMiddleware`` class has two methods, ``request`` and
``response``, each of which wraps a callable that does the work of sending or receiving, respectively. See the
`<ClientMiddleware reference documentation <reference.rst#class-clientmiddleware>`_ for more information about how to
implement Client middleware.


Middleware configuration
************************

``Middleware`` classes are configured using the standard PySOA plugin schema, though specific middleware will generally
provide an extended schema with more strict ``kwargs`` values.

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "path": <path to middleware class>,
        "kwargs": <optional dict of keyword args>,
    }


Metrics
+++++++
PySOA is capable of recording detailed metrics about the use and performance of its Client and Server transports and
sending and receiving processes. If you wish to gather metrics about the performance of PySOA, you will need to enable
this metrics recording in your server settings and/or in your client settings and provide an object which PySOA can use
to record these metrics.


``MetricsRecorder``
*******************

Metrics in PySOA are recorded with an implementation of the ``MetricsRecorder`` abstract class. By default, PySOA ships
with and uses a ``NoOpMetricsRecorder`` that does nothing when metrics are recorded. In order to record metrics in your
application, you will need to supply an implementation that knows about your metrics backend (such as Graphite or
DataDog) and understands how to record counters and timers. See the reference documentations for `Counter
<reference.rst#abstract-class-counter>`_, `Timer <reference.rst#abstract-class-timer>`_, `TimerResolution
<reference.rst#enum-timerresolution>`_, and `MetricsRecorder <reference.rst#abstract-class-metricsrecorder>`_ to learn
how to implement a recorder for your metrics soultion.


Metrics configuration
*********************

Metrics are configured using the standard PySOA plugin schema, though your metrics recorders will likely provide an
extended schema with more strict ``kwargs`` values.

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "path": <path to class implementing MetricsRecorder>,
        "kwargs": <optional dict of keyword args passed to your MetricsRecorder class when instantiated>,
    }

PySOA does not automatically append any sort of library- or service-distinguishing prefix to the metrics it records
(see `Which metrics are recorded`_ below). We recommend your ``MetricsRecorder`` append some type of prefix to all
metrics names passed to it (or uses tagging if your metrics backend understands that) so that you can group all PySOA
metrics together.

Customizing configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``pysoa.common.settings`` module provides classes that contain and validate common settings for Clients and Servers,
while ``pysoa.client.settings`` and ``pysoa.server.settings`` have Client- and Server-specific settings, respectively,
and various transports and middleware may also define their own settings schemas. The PySOA settings feature has three
primary functions: schema validation, defaults, and import resolution.

- Schema validation: Settings performs validation on input values using
  `Conformity <https://github.com/eventbrite/conformity>`_. Subclasses merge their schema with that of their parents,
  to a depth of 1, such that a settings class's schema will be the sum total of its defined schema and that of all of
  its parents' and parents' parents' schemas, and so forth. You cannot use multiple inheritance with settings classes.

- Defaults: Subclasses may define defaults as a dictionary. Defaults defined on a subclass will be merged with the
  defaults of its parent, to a depth of 1, just like the schema, *before validation occurs*. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      class BaseSettings(Settings):
          schema = {
              "foo": conformity.fields.Integer(),
              "bar": conformity.fields.SchemalessDictionary(key_type=conformity.fields.UnicodeString()),
          }
          defaults = {
              "foo": 1,
              "bar": {"qux": 2},
          }

      class MySettings(BaseSettings):
          defaults = {
              "bar": {"qux": 3}
          }

  The class ``MySettings`` in this example will have the defaults ``{"foo": 1, "bar": {"qux": 3}}``. This provides a
  measure of convenience while discouraging deep inheritance structures.

  When a ``Settings`` instance is created, the provided dictionary of values is merged recursively with the class's
  defaults:

  .. code-block:: python

      my_settings = MySettings({"bar": {"some_setting": 42}})

      In [1]: my_settings["foo"]
      Out[1]: 1

      In [2]: my_settings["bar"]["qux"]
      Out[2]: 3

      In [3]: my_settings["bar"]["some_setting"]
      Out[3]: 42

- Some settings specified by ``Settings`` subclasses might be instances of Conformity's ``ClassConfigurationSchema``. In
  these cases, the value is expected to be a dict with keys ``path`` (though this may have a default) and optionally
  ``kwargs``. ``path`` is the valid Python import path to the item, such as ``foo.bar.ExampleClass`` or
  ``baz.qux:ExampleClass``. ``kwargs`` is the keyword arguments necessary to instantiate that class, if applicable. The
  schema may also specify a required base class, and the schema will validate that the imported class is a subclass of
  that class. During validation, the schema will augment the dictionary containing ``path`` to also contain an
  ``object`` key whose value is the resolved Python type. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      class FooSettings(Settings):
            schema = {
                'turboencabulator': fields.ClassConfigurationSchema(base_class=AbstractTurboEncabulator),
            }

      my_settings = FooSettings({
          'turboencabulator': {
              'path': 'turbo.encabulator.Widget',
              'kwargs': {'address': '2604:a880:a82:fe8::ce:d003'},
          }
      })

      In [1]: repr(my_settings['turboencabulator']['object'])
      Out[1]: "<class 'turbo.encabulator.Widget'>"

  You can then instantiate the class with the provided settings as follows:

  .. code-block:: python

      widget = my_settings['turboencabulator']['object'](**my_settings['turboencabulator'].get('kwargs', {}))


  This feature is what powers the "PySOA plugin schema" referred to throughout this document.


Included ``Settings`` subclasses
********************************

There are several ``Settings`` subclasses provided throughout PySOA, and you can view more about them in the
`reference documentation <reference.rst>`_. This is a summary of the most common classes:

``pysoa.common.settings.SOASettings``
  Provides a schema that is shared by both Servers and Clients. It's schema:

  - ``transport``: Import path and keyword args for a ``Transport`` class.
  - ``metrics``: Import path and keyword args for a ``MetricsRecorder`` class (defaults to a no-op/null recorder).
  - ``middleware``: List of dicts containing import path and keyword args for a ``ClientMiddleware`` or
    ``ServerMiddleware`` class.

  Both the ``client`` and ``server`` modules implement their own subclasses that inherit from ``SOASettings``.
  Developers implementing ``Client`` or ``Server`` subclasses may wish to subclass the respective settings class in
  order to alter or extend the settings.

Client Settings
  Several classes provide schemas specifically for PySOA Clients:

  - ``pysoa.client.settings.ClientSettings`` extends ``SOASettings`` to provide a client-specific schema. It enforces
    that ``middleware`` is only Client middleware and that the ``transport`` is only a Client transport.
  - ``pysoa.client.settings.RedisClientSettings`` extends ``ClientSettings`` to enforce the ``RedisClientTransport``
    settings schema on the ``transport`` setting
  - ``pysoa.client.settings.LocalClientSettings`` extends ``ClientSettings`` to enforce the ``LocalClientTransport``
    settings schema on the ``transport`` setting
  - ``pysoa.client.settings.PolymorphicClientSettings`` extends ``ClientSettings`` and is deprecated. ``ClientSettings``
    is polymorphic already and should be used, instead.

Server Settings
  Several classes provide schemas specifically for PySOA Servers:

  - ``pysoa.server.settings.ServerSettings`` extends ``SOASettings`` to provide a server-specific schema. It adds:

    - ``client_routing``: Client settings for any PySOA clients that the server or its middleware will need to create
      to call other services; if provided, the server adds a ``Client`` instance as key ``client`` to the
      ``action_request`` dict before passing it to the middleware and as attribute ``client`` to the ``action_request``
      objcet before passing it to the action; each key must be a unicode string service name and each value the
      corresponding ``ClientSettings``-enforced client settings dict
    - ``logging``: Settings for configuring Python logging in the standard Python logging configuration format:

      - ``version``: Must be the value 1 until Python supports something different
      - ``formatters``: A dict of formatter IDs to dicts of formatter configs
      - ``filters``: A dict of filter IDs to dicts of filter configs
      - ``handlers``: A dict of handler IDs to dicts of handler configs
      - ``loggers``: A dict of logger names to dicts of logger configs
      - ``root``: The root logger config dict
      - ``incremental``: A Boolean for whether the configuration is to be interpreted as incremental to the existing
        configuration (Python defaults this to ``False``, and so does PySOA)
      - ``disable_existing_loggers``: A Boolean for whether existing loggers are to be disabled (Python defaults this
        to ``True`` for legacy reasons and ignores its value if ``incremental`` is ``True``; PySOA defaults this value
        to ``False`` to allow module-level ``getLogger`` calls, and you almost never want to change it to ``True``)

    - ``harakiri``: Settings for killing long-running jobs that may have run away or frozen or blocked transport
      processes that may be in a bind, unable to become unblocked; a dict with the following format:

      - ``timeout``: After this many seconds without finishing processing a request or receiving a transport timeout,
        the server will attempt to gracefully shut down (the value 0 disables this feature, defaults to 300 seconds)
      - ``shutdown_grace``: If a graceful shutdown does not succeed, the server will forcefully shut down after this
        many additional seconds (must be greater than 0, defaults to 30 seconds)

  - ``pysoa.server.settings.RedisServerSettings`` extends ``ServerSettings`` to enforce the ``RedisServerTransport``
    settings schema on the ``transport`` setting
  - ``pysoa.server.settings.LocalServerSettings`` extends ``ServerSettings`` to enforce the ``LocalServerTransport``
    settings schema on the ``transport`` setting
  - ``pysoa.server.settings.PolymorphicServerSettings`` extends ``ServerSettings`` and is deprecated. ``ServerSettings``
    is polymorphic already and should be used, instead.
