    Takes a dict and returns an immutable, hashable version of that dict that can be used as a key in dicts or as a
    set value. Any two dicts passed in with the same content are guaranteed to return the same value. Any two dicts
    passed in with different content are guaranteed to return different values. Performs comparatively to `repr`.
